# Tools-for-SLBs

The Fiji-based toolbox for the analysis of images containing phase-separated (liquid-ordered - liquid-disordered) planar lipid bilayers (e.g. Supported Lipid Bilayers - SLBs)

In order to use Fiji-based macro, download:

The toolbox contains three macros:

## 1. Binding location
- Identify the binding location of micrometer-sized particles at the SLB
- Distinguishes the following locations: Lo-domains, Ld-domains, Lo/Ld boundaries
## 2. Clustering
- Quantifies the sizes of the clusters of micrometer-sized particles on the surface of SLB
- Quatifies growth of clusters over time
- Does not estimate the number of partivles in the cluster
## 3. Phase domains area analysis:
- Extract the sizes of membrane domains (liquid ordered, liquid disordered), membrane defects, membrane multilayers/attached vesicles. 
- The objects are distinguished by the differences in gray scale. 
- Monitor sizes of the objects over time
